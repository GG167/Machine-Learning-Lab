I\\'m >philosophically< opposed to it\\nbecause of its complexity.\\n\\nThis complexity has led to some programs\\' poor TIFF writers making\\nsome very bizarre files, other programs\\' inability to load TIFF\\nimages (though they\\'ll save them, of course), and a general\\ninability to interchange images between different environments\\ndespite the fact they all think they understand TIFF.\\n\\nAs the saying goes, \"It\\'s not me I\\'m worried about- it\\'s all the\\n>other<  assholes out there!\"  I\\'ve had big trouble with misuse and\\nabuse of TIFF over the years, and I chalk it all up to the immense (and\\nunnecessary) complexity of the format.\\n\\nIn the words of the TIFF 5.0 spec, Appendix G, page G-1 (capitalized\\nemphasis mine):\\n\\n\"The only problem with this sort of success is that TIFF was designed\\nto be powerful and flexible, at the expense of simplicity.  It takes a\\nfair amount of effort to handle all the options currently defined in\\nthis specification (PROBABLY NO APPLICATION DOES A COMPLETE JOB),\\nand that is currently the only way you can be >sure< that you will be\\nable to import any TIFF image, since there are so many\\nimage-generating applications out there now.\"\\n\\n\\nIf a program (or worse all applications) can\\'t read >every< TIFF\\nimage, that means there are some it won\\'t- some that I might have to\\ndeal with.  Why would I want my images to be trapped in that format?  I\\ndon\\'t and neither should anyone who agrees with my reasoning- not\\nthat anyone does, of course! :-)\\n\\nab\\n'\n",
